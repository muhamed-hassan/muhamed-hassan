"We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us."

[**SELF-STUDY**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) materials are made to fuck (هينيك ويذل فى دين أمك) the countryside savage dogs who are not educated at all and do nasty things when they become [instructor if they worked as teacher, teaching assistant, professor, ... etc](https://github.com/muhamed-hassan/safe_planet/wiki/Crazy-instructors). 

Their shit 💩 can be:

* not knowing its specialization or the contents of the topic under its discussion AKA an ignorant person.
* wasting time in going a lot to bathroom or taking a lot of unjustified vacations.
* suffering from hangover during the session to its audience.
* [wearing improper clothes as nomadic ones](https://github.com/muhamed-hassan/specialized-software-development-company-java-backend/wiki/Improper-clothes-to-conduct-business), which in turn produces negative energy during the session.
* speaking like thugs using improper voice tone.
* not being on time.
* [terrorizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism) kids, while when those kids grow up a bit, they start fucking them (هيفشخوا دين أهلكم يا ولاد المعرصين يا جهلة يا مرتدين يا كفرة).

Please note that references (book with a huge amount of knowledge in certain domain) are not studied from page 1 till the end. It's called a reference to hold a huge amount of knowledge. To use it properly without exhausting yourself, you have to check the [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(publishing)) of the reference first, then check the details of the topic you want. That's why education is important and you should get education from an instructor at the first place, before moving to self-study mode to make sure you absorbed the knowledge well and be able to apply it in your life later well.
